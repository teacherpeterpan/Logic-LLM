Given a problem description and a question. The task is to formulate the problem as a logic program, consisting three parts: Declarations, Constraints, and Options.
Declarations: Declare the variables and functions.
Constraints: Write the constraints in the problem description as logic formulas.
Options: Write the options in the question as logic formulas.

Problem:
On Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The following is all that is known about what they eat during that day: At no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy.

Problem:
In a repair facility there are exactly six technicians: Stacy, Urma, Wim, Xena, Yolanda, and Zane. Each technician repairs machines of at least one of the following three types—radios, televisions, and VCRs—and no other types. The following conditions apply: Xena and exactly three other technicians repair radios. Yolanda repairs both televisions and VCRs. Stacy does not repair any type of machine that Yolanda repairs. Zane repairs more types of machines than Yolanda repairs. Wim does not repair any type of machine that Stacy repairs. Urma repairs exactly two types of machines.
Question:
Which one of the following pairs of technicians could repair all and only the same types of machines as each other?
Choices:
(A) Stacy and Urma
(B) Urma and Yolanda
(C) Urma and Xena
(D) Wim and Xena

Problem:
Workers at a water treatment plant open eight valves—G, H, I, K, L, N, O, and P—to flush out a system of pipes that needs emergency repairs. To maximize safety and efficiency, each valve is opened exactly once, and no two valves are opened at the same time. The valves are opened in accordance with the following conditions: Both K and P are opened before H. O is opened before L but after H. L is opened after G. N is opened before H. I is opened after K.
Question: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:
Choices:
(A) H
(B) I
(C) K
(D) N
(E) O
