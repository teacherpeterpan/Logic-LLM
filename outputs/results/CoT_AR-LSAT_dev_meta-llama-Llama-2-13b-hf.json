    "question": "Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that Generations starts on the hour rather than the half hour, would have the same effect in determining the order in which the programs are shown?",
    "answer": "C",
    "predicted_reasoning": "The constraint that Generations starts on the hour rather than the half hour means that Generations is shown at 1 P.M. and not at 1:30 P.M. If we substitute the constraint that Generations is not shown immediately before Terry, then Generations can be shown at 1 P.M. and Terry can be shown at 1:30 P.M. This constraint has the same effect as the original constraint. Therefore, the final answer is A.",
