Therefore, Bonnie is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic careers and educational opportunities. If Bonnie is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic careers and educational opportunities, then she is inactive and disinterested members of their community. All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. Therefore, Bonnie chaperones high school dances. If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school. Therefore, Bonnie is not a student who attends the school. Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. Therefore, Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.
