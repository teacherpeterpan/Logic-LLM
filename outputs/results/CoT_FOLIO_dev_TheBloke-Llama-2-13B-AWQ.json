If Remy does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then Remy does not have a fully stocked and impressive home office. All people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home. Therefore, Remy does not have a fully stocked and impressive home office. All people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly. If Remy does not visit the office supply store regularly, then Remy does not work regularly and often at home. If people work regularly and often at home, then they own a large desktop monitor at their home. Therefore, Remy does not own a large desktop monitor at their home.",
