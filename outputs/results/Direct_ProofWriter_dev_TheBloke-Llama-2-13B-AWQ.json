    "predicted_reasoning": "#1 New York Times bestselling author of the year, and the winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Elizabeth Strout, has once again brought to life an exquisite and deeply moving novel of human resilience.\nIn the wake of his fathers death, Prince Hal, the heir to the throne, has been thrust onto the world stage and into a dangerous political labyrinth of greed and deceit. With Richard the Lionheart, long believed to be dead, returning to the land, the future of the kingdom hangs in the balance. Even more tenuous is the fate of Henrys mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. A beautiful, volatile, and brilliant woman, Eleanor has been the linchpin of a vast political inheritance; now their rivals circle her.\nCaught in the maelstrom are the companions who have been forced to flee with her: her beloved son, Richard; her two sons by her first marriage; her dead husbands young mistress, Princess Alais; and a young monk, whom she has taken with her in the hope that his learning and piety can help her in a desperate time.\nIn a novel of historical fiction, Elizabeth Strout explores the triumphs and perils of power and the loneliness of powerlessness, and introduces the reader to a rich cast of characters: the future King Richard the Lionheart, who has come to love his mother for the first time; his squire and mother s lover, Berengaria of Navarre; the itinerant and passionate troubadour, Blondel; and his own mother, a woman both revered and reviled, and a woman who understands the high stakes in the game of thrones.\nElizabeth Strout is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Olive Kitteridge, as well as the #1 New York Times bestsellers Abide with Me, Amy and Isabelle, and The Burgess Boys, which was a finalist for the National Book Award.

    "predicted_reasoning": "#1 New York Times bestselling author of the year, and the winner of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Donna Tartt is the author of seven novels, including The Secret History of Las Vegas, The Little Friend, and The Goldfinch, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2014. Her work has been translated into thirty-eight languages, and she has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, and the National Humanities Medal, which was awarded at the White House in 2012. She lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\"The Secret History is the most exquisite, haunting book I've read in years. It's sophisticated, wise, incredibly suspenseful, and beautifully written, with a secret at its heart that grows more astonishing as the pages turn. I wish I'd written it.\"\n--A.J. Finn, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Woman in the Window\n\"A dark, harrowing work that grabs the reader by the throat and refuses to let go. The characters are unique, well-developed, and complex. The storyline is original and compelling. The writing is beautiful. This is a stunning first novel.\"\n--Sue Grafton\n\"A genuinely chilling novel about an insular prep school community in the early 1980s, a vicious murder, and the intrigue surrounding it. I couldn't put it down.\"\n--Scott Turow, author of Presumed Innocent and Identical\n\"A dark, twisty, beautifully written whodunit that keeps you guessing until the very end.\"\n--Ruth Ware, New York Times bestselling author of The Woman in Cabin 10\n\"A psychologically astute, stunningly well-plotted, and suspenseful novel that is also movielicous in its richly textured, hyper-real quality. Donna Tartt is a wonderful writer, and The Secret History is a terrific book.\"\n--Scott Smith, author of The Ruins and A Simple Plan\n\"A remarkable first novel. The story is clever and stylishly told, but what raises the book above the ordinary are the insights it offers into the nature of friendship and the betrayals that can occur when friends turn into lovers. Donna Tartt has a natural storyteller's ear for dialogue and a fine sense of the ridiculous. I shall look forward to her next book.\"\n--Sebastian Faulks\n\"A mesmerizing, incredibly engaging novel. The Secret History is a haunting, beautifully written book with an ending that is devastating in its impact.\"\n--Howard Frank Mosher\n\"A darkly brilliant first novel.
